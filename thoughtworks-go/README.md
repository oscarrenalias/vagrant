This is a Vagrant VM for ThoughtWorks Go.

Run ```vagrant up``` to start the VM. The VM is based on my own CentOS 6.4 image, which is pulled from my personal Dropbox user folder.

The configuration of the VM inclues a Go server, an agent so that it can run jobs, Git as well as Maven so that it's ready to go to build Java projects.
